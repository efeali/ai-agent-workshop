This project is an example showing how we can use Hugging Face's inference models remotely. 
For this we need:
- Hugging Face account, then create access token (read only)
- `.env` file containing `HF_TOKEN` access token.


##### Setup
1. `python -m venv .venv`
2. `.venv\Scripts\activate`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Add your Hugging Face token into `.env` file

##### To run
1. `python main.py`
